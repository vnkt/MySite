    PivotX is a feature rich weblogging tool that is simple enough for the novice
    weblogger to use and complex enough to meet the demands of advanced webmasters.
    It can be used to publish a variety of websites from the most basic weblog to very advanced CMS style solutions.

    PivotX is - if we do say so ourselves - is quite an impressive piece of software. It
    is made even better through the use of several external libraries. We thank their
    authors for the time taken to develop these very useful tools and for making
    them available to others.

<p>
    Development of PivotX (originally Pivot) started back in 2001 and has continuously
    forged ahead thanks to the efforts of a lot
    of dedicated and very talented people. The PivotX core team is still very active
    but keep in mind that PivotX would not be what it is today without the valuable
    contributions made by several other people. They are listed below.
