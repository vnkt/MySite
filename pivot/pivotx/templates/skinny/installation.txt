Skinny

This is the default theme for PivotX. It has all the common PivotX functionality built in. 
If you want to start developing themes yourself, this is a good one to tear apart and to learn from.

This folder contains files of the types html and tpl. The files of type html are only included for 
reasons of backward compatibility. If you have a new installation of PivotX (version 2.3 or later), 
you may simply delete the html-files.
