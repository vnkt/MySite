This is the default template for PivotX.

The theme comes in two versions, with two or three columns. You may select which version to use in the admin panel 
under Administration -> Weblogs -> Templates.

The theme comes with three different css-files:
	pivotx_dark.css
	pivotx_light.css
	pivotx_default.css
the last of these is used by default. You may choose another one by uncommenting the appropriate line in _sub_header.tpl.

The archive contains files of the types html and tpl. The files of type html are only included for 
reasons of backward compatibility. If you have a new installation of PivotX (version 2.3 or later), 
you may simply delete the html-files.
