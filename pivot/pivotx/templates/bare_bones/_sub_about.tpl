<h3>[[t]]About[[/t]]</h3>

<p>This is the 'Bare Bones' template for 
    <a href="http://www.pivotx.net" title="PivotX: a GPL weblog tool.">PivotX</a>. 
    It's not much to look at, but it's a good start to
    write your own templates. It contains most of the usual tags you'd like to
    have in a template, with a minimum of CSS/HTML.</p>
<p> You can change this text by editing the file <tt>'_sub_about.tpl'</tt> 
    in your <tt>pivotx/templates/bare_bones/</tt> folder. You can do this by directly editing the file, 
    or you can go to 'Manage Media' &raquo; 'Templates' in the PivotX interface.
