Bare Bones

This is the 'Bare Bones' template for PivotX.
 
It's not much to look at, but it's a good start to write your own templates. It contains most of the usual tags 
you'd like to have in a template, with a minimum of CSS/HTML.

The archive contains files of the types html and tpl. The files of type html are only included for 
reasons of backward compatibility. If you have a new installation of PivotX (version 2.3 or later), 
you may simply delete the html-files.
